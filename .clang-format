# Use the Google style in this project.
BasedOnStyle: Google

# Some folks prefer to write "int& foo" while others prefer "int &foo".  The
# Google Style Guide only asks for consistency within a project, we chose
# "int& foo" for this project:
#DerivePointerAlignment: false
#PointerAlignment: Left

#If true, analyze the formatted file for the most common alignment of & and *. Pointer and reference alignment styles are going to be updated according to the preferences found in the file. PointerAlignment is then used only as fallback.
#如果为真，则设置使用指针和引用书写方式最多的哪一种，设置为false，则根据PointerAlignment手动设置
DerivePointerAlignment: false
#指针位置
PointerAlignment: Left
#缩进宽度
IndentWidth: 4
#使用Tab
UseTab: Never
